 * Scheduler/Dispatcher support functions.
 * 
 * The main loop steps through and samples the channels at the millisecond level.  It invokes samplePower()
 * which samples one or more waves and updates the corresponding data buckets.  After each sample, there 
 * are a few milliseconds before the next AC zero crossing, so we try to do everything else during that
 * downtime.
 * 
 * To accomplish that, other activities are organized as SERVICEs that are scheduled and are dispatched in 
 * Loop during the half-cycle downtime. The ESP8266 is already running a lower level operating system that 
 * is task oriented and dispatches this program along with other tasks - most notably the WiFi stack. Ticker
 * taps into that and provides one time or periodic interrupts that could be used to run services, but we
 * run the channel sampling with interrupts disabled, and we really don't need sub-second scheduling for 
 * our services anyway, so Ticker is not used.
 * 
 * This mechanism schedules at a resolution of one second, and dispatches during the optimal time period
 * between AC cycles.  To avoid context and synchonization issues, each service is coded as a state-machine.
 * They must be well behaved and should try to run for less than a few milliseconds. Although that isn't
 * always possible and doesn't do any real harm if they run over - just reduces the sampling frequency a bit.
 * 
 * Services return the UNIXtime of the next requested dispatch.  If the requested time is in the past, 
 * the service is requeued at the current time, so if a service just wants to relinquish but reschedule 
 * for the next available opportunity, just return 1.  If a service returns zero, it's service block will
 * be deleted.  To reschedule, AddService would have to be called to create a new serviceBlock.
 * 
 * The schedule itself is kept as an ordered list of control blocks in ascending order of time + priority.
 * Loop simply invokes the service currently at the beginning of the list.
 * 
 * The WiFi server is not one of these services.  It is invoked each time through the loop because it
 * polls for activity.
